10M Build Docker
================

10M build Docker - Common build tools for dockers that need to compile / build an executable.
Usually per language build containers will inherit from it.

The tree under this should contain "builer" docker images that output executables.
These images should be used in development and in automated builds.
Production images should not be inheriting from this directly or indirectly if possible.
